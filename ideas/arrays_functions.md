Certainly! Here are 5 small coding exercises that can help students reinforce their learning of arrays and functions in JavaScript:

1. **Sum of Array Elements**:

   - Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function sumOfArray(arr) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(sumOfArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: 15
     ```

2. **Average of Two Arrays**:

   - Write a function that takes two arrays of numbers as input and returns the average of the sum of all the elements in both arrays.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function averageOfTwoArrays(arr1, arr2) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(averageOfTwoArrays([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])); // Output: 3.5
     ```

3. **Reverse Array**:

   - Write a function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with the elements in reverse order.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function reverseArray(arr) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(reverseArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
     ```

4. **Unique Elements**:

   - Write a function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with only the unique elements from the original array.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function uniqueElements(arr) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(uniqueElements([1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
     ```

5. **Intersection of Arrays**:

   - Write a function that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array with only the elements that are common to both arrays.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function intersectionOfArrays(arr1, arr2) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(intersectionOfArrays([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 4, 5, 6, 7])); // Output: [3, 4, 5]
     ```

These exercises cover a range of array operations, including sum, average, reversal, uniqueness, and intersection. They are designed to be simple enough for beginners to understand and implement, while also helping them develop a deeper understanding of arrays and functions in JavaScript.
