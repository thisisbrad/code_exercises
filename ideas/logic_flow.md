Certainly! Here are 5 coding exercises that focus on control flow, logical operations, and decision-making constructs like if-statements, switch statements, and function returns:

1. **Odd or Even**:

   - Write a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a string indicating whether the number is odd or even.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function oddOrEven(num) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(oddOrEven(7)); // Output: "Odd"
     console.log(oddOrEven(10)); // Output: "Even"
     ```

2. **Grade Calculator**:

   - Write a function that takes a numerical grade as an argument and returns a letter grade based on the following scale:
     - 90-100: "A"
     - 80-89: "B"
     - 70-79: "C"
     - 60-69: "D"
     - 0-59: "F"
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function calculateGrade(grade) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(calculateGrade(92)); // Output: "A"
     console.log(calculateGrade(75)); // Output: "C"
     console.log(calculateGrade(48)); // Output: "F"
     ```

3. **Leap Year**:

   - Write a function that takes a year as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year.
   - A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100. However, years that are divisible by 400 are also leap years.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function isLeapYear(year) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(isLeapYear(2024)); // Output: true
     console.log(isLeapYear(2023)); // Output: false
     console.log(isLeapYear(2000)); // Output: true
     ```

4. **Season Detector**:

   - Write a function that takes a month as an argument (1-12) and returns the corresponding season.
   - The seasons are defined as follows:
     - December, January, February: "Winter"
     - March, April, May: "Spring"
     - June, July, August: "Summer"
     - September, October, November: "Autumn"
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function detectSeason(month) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(detectSeason(3)); // Output: "Spring"
     console.log(detectSeason(8)); // Output: "Summer"
     console.log(detectSeason(11)); // Output: "Autumn"
     ```

5. **Vowel Counter**:

   - Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.
   - The function should be case-insensitive, meaning it should count both uppercase and lowercase vowels.
   - Example:

     ```javascript
     function countVowels(str) {
       // Your code here
     }

     console.log(countVowels("Hello, World!")); // Output: 3
     console.log(countVowels("JavaScript")); // Output: 3
     console.log(countVowels("Anthropic")); // Output: 4
     ```

These exercises cover various control flow constructs, such as if-statements, switch statements, and function returns, along with the concepts of truthy and falsy values. They are designed to help students practice their understanding of these fundamental programming constructs and apply them to solve simple problems.
